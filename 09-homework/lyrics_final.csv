http://www.metrolyrics.com/its-the-end-of-the-world-lyrics-rem.html,10,It's The End Of The World Lyrics,2008,"That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/losing-my-religion-lyrics-rem.html,9,Losing My Religion Lyrics,2003,"Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream"

Seolah seorang puteri ayu
Akan menjadi idaman mahkota hati
Lambang pengorbanan kita yang suci
Tetapi selingkar oh kasihmu
Telah terurai meragut dan menyakar
Hati ini jua
Masih lagi selingkar kasihmu
Yang menghantui prasedar dan merayu
Rindu daku jua
Oh...
Kepastian yang ku nanti
Tetapi engkau masih mencari
Cinta yang lain
Bukan dariku
Seharusnya cinta ini bisa berdiri
Sebagai sebuah istana megah
Menjadi persinggahan mahkota hati
Melambang kebahagian kita kasih"

http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-sidewinder-sleeps-tonight-lyrics-rem.html,7,The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight Lyrics,2006,"This here is the place i will be staying.
there isn't a number. you can call the pay phone.
let it ring a long, long, long, long time.
if i don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more.
if i don't pick up, pick up... the sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
There are scratches all around the coin slot
like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up,
but this machine can only swallow money.
you can't lay a patch by computer design.
it's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs.
Tell her,
tell her she can kiss my ass, then laugh and say that you were only kidding.
that way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me.
today i need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial.
a can of beans or blackeyed peas, some nescafe and ice,
a candy bar, a falling star, or a reading of doctor seuss;
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way,
always had a smile and a reason to pretend.
but their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream.
the sidewinder sleeps on his back.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
We've got to moogie, moogie, move on this one."
http://www.metrolyrics.com/nightswimming-lyrics-rem.html,6,Nightswimming Lyrics,2003,"Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still its so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day
Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
That bright tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming
You, I thought I knew you
You, I can not judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming
The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night"

And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on
Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/fall-on-me-lyrics-rem.html,6,Fall On Me Lyrics,2011,"There's a problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towers
Foresight isn't anything at all
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me
(Well I would keep it above but then it wouldn't be sky any more)
(So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home)
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky, and ask the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)

I will make it through the night

I have never been the gifted type
Hey, man, tell me something, are you off to somewhere?
Do you want to go with me tonight?
I know, I know, I know that this is changing
We walk the streets to feel the ground I'm chasing: ÃBerlin

Water hyacinth
Named by a poet
Imitation of life

Like a goldfish in a bowl
I don't want to hear you cry
That sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
Come on, come on
No one can see you try
You want the greatest thing
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
You've got it all
You've got it sized
Like a Friday fashion show teenager
Freezing in the corner
Trying to look like you don't try
That sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
Come on, come on
No one can see you try

That sugarcane that tasted good
That's freezing rain, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cry
This sugarcane, this lemonade
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cry
This lightning storm, this tidal wave
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cry
That sugarcane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cry
That sugarcane that tasted good

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine"

She's three miles of bad road
Walking down the street
Will I never meet her?
She's a real woman-child
Oh my kiss breath turpentine

I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
Have you seen her come around?
My crush with eyeliner
I'm in like
I'm infatuated
It's all too much pressure

What position should I wear?
Cop an attitude? (You faker)
How can I convince her? (Faker)
That I'm invented, too, yeah

I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
We all invent ourselves

What can I make myself be?
Life is strange, yeah (Life is strange)

Won't you be my valentine?

I will rearrange your scales if I can, and I can
Marching to the ocean, marching to the sea, I had a hat
I dropped it down and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever
I wish to meet each one of you
And you meet you, if I can, and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go
Now I'm not feeding off you

Carry each his burden, we are young despite the years

this letter
fields of poppies, little pearls
all the boys and all the girls sweet-toothed
each and every one a little scary
I said your name
I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
dreaming of Maria Callas
whoever she is
this fame thing, I don't get it
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves
I can take you far
this star thing, I don't get it

adrenaline, it pulls us near

will you ever welcome me?
will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
smoke it, drink
here comes the flood
anything to thin the blood
these corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
phone, eat it, drink
just another chink
cuts and dents, they catch the light
aluminum, the weakest link
I don't want to disappoint you
I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet
but is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown and sadness and sorrow
and who'd have thought tomorrow could be so strange?
my loss, and here we go again

I can't look it in the eyes
seconal, Spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene
cherry-flavored neck and collar
I can smell the sorrow on your breath
the sweat, the victory and sorrow
the smell of fear, I got it
I'll take you over, there
I'll take you over, there
aluminum, tastes like fear
adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over

Lost lamb off the precipice into the trickle down runoff pool

They amplified the autumn, 1979

I'm just profoundly frustrated by all this

There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone
Let it ring a long, long, long, long time
If I don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more, oh
If I don't pick up, pick up
The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up
But this machine can only swallow money
You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs
Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
A can of beans or blackeyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh

These words, ""You will be mine.""
These words, ""You will be mine."" all the time.
The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes,
bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love,
make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine.
These words, ""You will be mine.""
These words, ""You will be mine."" all the time. oh
I tripped and fell, and did I fall.
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
You know with love come strange currencies
and here is my appeal:
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance,
a word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, ""You will be mine."" all the time. oh
These words, ""You will be mine.""
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray,
say, love's confined, on Earth"

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord
Count your blessings
We're sick of being jerked around
We all fall down

Investigation dance? Those ants in pants glances
Well, look behind the eyes, it's a hallowed hollow anesthetized
Save my own ass, screw these guys, smoke and mirror lock down
Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, Lord

We blamed it on the other guy
Sure, all men are created equal
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Please stay tuned, we cut to sequel
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

The bull and the bear are marking their territories
They're leading the blind with their international glories
I am the screen, the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night
I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Don't wake me with so much

I cried the other night
I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
It's furious balancing
I am the screen, the blinding light

Comes calling back, a brilliant night, I'm still awake
I looked ahead, I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me to tell you now that nothing can compare
You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden your frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out
Now life is sweet, and what it brings I tried to take
But loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in wait
And all not lost, still in my eye
Shadow of necklace across your thigh
I might have lived my life in a dream, but I swear it, this is real
Memory fuses and shatters like glass
Mercurial future, forget the past
But it's you, it's what I feel
You might have laughed if I told you (It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden your frown (Change)
You might have succeeded in changing me (It's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around (Change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind (It's pulling me apart)

The whole world hinges on your swings
Your secret life of indiscreet discretions
I'd turn the screw and leave the screen,
Don't point your finger,
You know that's not my thing
You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go, now
You've got a little worry,
I know it all too well,
I've got your number,
But so does every kiss-and-tell
Who dares to cross your threshold,
Or happens on your way,
Stop laying blame
You know that's not my thing
You know that's not my thing,
You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go
You kiss on me, tug on me, 
rub on me, jump on me,
You bang on me, beat on me, 
hit on me, let go on me,
You let go on me"

Love is all around me and so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show
You know I love you I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
I see your face before me, as I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking of all the things we said
You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do
You know I love you I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show

Into the life you hope to live
And suddenly you wake up
In a shaking panic, now
You set me up like a lamb to slaughter
Garbo ask the farmer's daughter
Unbelievable the gospel according to who
I lay right down
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well is the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
Try turn your talking points on me
History will set me free
The future's ours and you don't even read
The footnote now
So who's chasing me? Where did you go?
You disappear mid sentence sinner
In a judgment crisis I see my anecdote fall out
You weakened shell
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
You say it with your dying breath
Well I forgive but I don't forget
You work it out, let's hear that argument
Count the count of three go, now
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
Well I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well is the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I'm calling you on, oh

All flashing pulsar
I move across the earth in my new pattern shirt
I pass satellites
""You're so bitter,"" your complaint
I can't give you anything
I don't know who you're livin' for
I don't who you are anymore
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
I move across, candy floss
I move like a tank
I move across the room with a heart full of gloom
I'm stronger than you think
Oh, my peer, your veneer
Is wearing thin and cracking
The surface informs that underneath
The underneath is lacking
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
You move across, innocence lost
All static and desire
You're blue in the face from navel gaze
You set yourself on fire
You strip down and lay yourself out
I know you can't fake it
But are you tired and naked?
Are you tired and naked?
Yeah, I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for

Take a break, driver 8

We've been on this shift too long
And the train conductor says
Take a break, driver 8
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away, but it's still a ways away
I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
The bells are ringing through the town again
The children look up, all they hear is sky-blue bells ringing
And the train conductor says
Take a break, driver 8
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away, but it's still a ways away
But we're still a ways away, but it's still a ways away
A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself to sleep
A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself, my children to sleep
He piloted this song in a plane like that one
She is selling faith on the Go Tell Crusade
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again
The fields of wheat is looking thin
And the train conductor says
Take a break, driver 8
Driver 8, take a break
We've been on this shift too long
And the train conductor says
Take a break, driver 8

The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand
Of the power, the only vote that matters
Silence means security, silence means approval
Watchin' Zenith on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again like Martin Luthers in
The mythology begins the begin
Answer me a question, I can't itemize
I can't think clearly, look to me for reason
It's not there, I can't even rhyme, begin the begin
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Example, the finest example is you
Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand

Oh, I see this echoing
You have placed your trust in me
I went upside down
I emptied out the room

I can't believe you held your ground
Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me
It seems a shame to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me
Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down
These things they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me
It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same, save the shame for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me
Baby's got some new rules
Baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey
And baby's got a baby with me

It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
The neighbors go to bed at ten
Call the prayer line for a change
The charge is changing every month
They said it couldn't be arranged
We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow
I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Your sister said that you're too young
She should know she's been there twice
The call was two and fifty-one
They said it couldn't be arranged
We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow
The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere

I knocked my head against the sky.
The dragonflies are busy buzzing me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.
Halfway from coal, halfway to diamond.
My fall knocked a mean chip out of me.
I'm gathering as far as I can reach
We're perched upon the precipice
And this is what I've seen.
This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.
A bluejay hectors from the felled Catalpa tree
A doctorate in science and a theologian's dream.
The dragonflies are trying to lecture me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.
This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.
Beat a drum for me, like a butterfly wing
Tropical storm across the ocean.
Don't explain, I'm sure I'll want to know.
Don't forget, we're just halfway from coal.
This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need."

You're only as big as your battles.
Rattle my cage with your shadow.
I'm a phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.
Don't darken my doorstep again,
You're mixing up living in chin-chin,
You're mixing up lose with win-win,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.
You stumble on glass top table,
TV's chewing shock-gone cable
Pump me up a beanstalk fable
And I'll call this entertainment
'cause Humpty's falling down.
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.
Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night f**kin' fried-up pub crawl
Phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.
It's not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round
It's going down, down, down
This runaround, round, round
Is bound to pound
The daylights out of you!"

I accepted with a gentle tongue
No words spoken, no need to speak
Take it, stomp twice, ring the bell
Tether that ring and phrase
Enough with the rifle and talk already
We all know what it means
Take this conversation to your great divide

Silly rule, golden words make practice, practice makes perfect
Perfect is a fault, and fault lines change

Say what?
Hey, hey, hey
Check it out
What are you saying?
What are you playing?
Who are you obeying?
Day out, day in, huh?
Baby, baby, baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their life- radio listeners"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/finest-worksong-lyrics-rem.html,1,Finest Worksong Lyrics,2008,"The time to rise has been engaged
You're better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Your finest hour"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/hyena-lyrics-rem.html,1,Hyena Lyrics,2006,"Night time fell at the opening
In the final act of the beginning of time
Hyena, take your role, the stage is set
The town is safe again tonight
Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)
Hyena, sister, look to your hand
Man, you serve communal interest
She'll tell you when and where and how and why you'd hurt
A beautiful young lady
Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)
The only thing to fear is fearlessness
The bigger the weapon, the greater the fear
Hyena is ambassador to here
Nighttime fell like the closing
Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonight
Hyena (I see the changes, man)
Hyena (going on across the way)
Hyena (I see my road ahead)
Hyena (don't know if I should stay)
Hyena (I see you holding him)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)"

Maybe some day
I need never be alone
I know I say
It's the right way
But you'll never be the one
I've been walking alone now
For a long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends who just aren't mine
Party to party
You've been looking
But your search will never end
You've been hanging
With the wrong crowd
You've got all the right friends
I've been walking alone now
For a long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends that just aren't mine
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/walk-unafraid-lyrics-rem.html,1,Walk Unafraid Lyrics,2006,"As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down
These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb, a little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laid
They claim to walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Say ""Keep within the boundaries if you want to play""
Say ""Contradiction only makes it harder""
How can I be what I want to be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up
And walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fall
To walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high"
http://www.metrolyrics.com/so-central-rain-lyrics-rem.html,1,So. Central Rain Lyrics,2011,"Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The trees will bend, the cities wash away
The city on the river there is a girl without a dream
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Eastern to Mountain, third party call, the lines are down
The wise man built his words upon the rocks
But I'm not bound to follow suit
The trees will bend, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another home, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The ocean sang, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another dream, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

New Order covers,
Young Marble Giants
I sat... quietly... waiting...
For someone else to make the first move,
Someone else to make the first move...
That someone is you
That someone is you!
That someone has pulled me up and out of
cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!
And with the fury lock of Sharon Stone Casino,
Scarface, Al Pacino, '74 Torino. I need
someone else to make the first move,
Someone else to make the first move,
That someone is you
That someone is you!
That someone has pulled me up and out of
cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me...
You
Pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!"

A mean idea to call my own
Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point,
Point observation, children carry reservations
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold, leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly
Singer sing me a given
Singer sing me a song
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Everybody's looking on
[(Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young, there's time to teach, point to point, point observation, children carry reservations)]
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly away, away, away
I am king of all I see
My kingdom for a voice
Old man don't lay so still, you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold, leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly away, away, away
Everybody hit the ground

Becomes your special book, it was simple then
When the party lulls, if we fall by the side
Will you be remembered, will she be remembered
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face
I fell by your bed once, I didn't want to tell you
I should keep myself in between the pages
Of the green light room, if we fall by the side
Will you be remembered, will she be remembered
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face
From the inside room when the front room greeting
Becomes your special book, it was simple then
When the party lulls, if we fall by the side
I still like you, can you remember
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face"

Comes from somewhere
But they would just as soon forget
and disguise
Disguised as they know what I made I feel it
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers or cares
No one cares if your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets
Two, three, four
If you call out safe then I'll stop right away
If the premise explode and the world starts to shake
For the details great
With the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station
No one cares if your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets
Everybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget,
And disguise
Disguised as they know what I feel I feel it
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
A celebration Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares"

Tell me how to feel?
I know where we boomeranged and fell from grace.
Point me to the stars I'm up for the chase.
I know where we fell on our face.
Jump with me.
You jump with me.
Hey, what's the big deal-
I'm an animal.

I'm an animal.
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.)
I'm an animal.
(It's calling me to work it out.) (Whoa)
I don't wanna boomerang.
I don't wanna cannonball.
I'm not angling.
I don't want to fall.
Tell me I'm the anchor of my own ascension.
Tell me I'm a tourist in the 4th dimension?
Hey, what's the big deal-
I'm an animal.

I'm an animal.

I am vibrating at the speed of light.
Take my hand, we'll wind up the night.
Spin me, win me, lift me, kiss me.
Trip me, trust me, cuss me, judge me.

http://www.metrolyrics.com/disappear-lyrics-rem.html,1,Disappear Lyrics,2014,"I've dragged my feet
Across the seat
And jumped out the passenger side.
The only thing worth looking for
Is what you find inside.
But that had not yet appeared.
Lost, invisible, here.
Tel Aviv and Agadir,
Taroudant and Olomouc
Before I learned to see
The vanishing point appear.
I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spend half my life figuring what comes next.
I telescoped in.
I'll finally win,
I'll finally win the prize.
That now my eyes see
A comic's perfect timing squeezed.
I'm headfirst fighting everything
The crushed force of memory
Erasing all I've been
The vanishing point appears.
I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear.
Look at this face.
Can you believe it?
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum,
Because I can't see it.
The vanishing point appears.
I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
I came to disappear."

They've found some surplus cheaper hands
Rubbing palms and pick and choose
Who will they choose? Here is the news
Look at that building, look at this man
Haloed and whitewashed gone to find a cheaper hand
He'll offer a pound, offer a pound
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home
Pay for your freedom, find another gate
Guilt by associate, the rushes wilted a long time ago
Guilty as you go
Stay off that highway, word is it's not so safe
Grasses that hide the greenback
The amber waves of gain again
The amber waves of gain
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go"

She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Courage built a bridge, jealousy tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
And like Kohoutek you were gone
We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talked
She wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped
Like a fish, like a flying friend
You were gone, like Kohoutek, can't forget that
Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow who will stand alone
Maybe you're not the problem, scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
Like Kohoutek, you were gone
Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down
If I stand and holler will I stand alone"

Tell me you'll soon be flying
Into the Arms, into the arms of love
Maybe tonight you're takin'
You couldn't get enough
Honey you'll soon be wakin'
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love
Maybe the world is falling
It wasn't strong enough
Tell me you'll soon be crawling
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love
